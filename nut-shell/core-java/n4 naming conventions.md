1. **Class Names**: Should be nouns in UpperCamelCase. Example: `Student`, `Color`.
2. **Interface Names**: Like class names, should be nouns or noun phrases in UpperCamelCase. Example: `List`, `Readable`.
3. **Method Names**: Should be verbs or verb phrases in lowerCamelCase. Example: `addActionListener`, `getName`.
4. **Variable Names**: Also in lowerCamelCase. Short, meaningful names are preferred. Example: `buttonWidth`, `currentPage`.
5. **Constant Names**: Should be in all uppercase letters with underscores separating words. Example: `MAX_WIDTH`, `DEFAULT_COLOR`.
6. **Package Names**: Should be in all lowercase. When multiple words are combined, they should be concatenated (no underscores). Example: `java.util`, `com.example.project`.
7. **Type Parameter Names**: Single capital letter, possibly followed by a number. The most commonly used type parameter names are `E` for element, `K` for key, `N` for number, `T` for type, `V` for value. Example: `T`, `E`, `K`, `V`.
8. **Enum Names**: Like class names, should be in UpperCamelCase. However, the constants within an enum should be all uppercase. Example: `enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE; }`.
9. **Annotation Names**: Follow the rules of class names (UpperCamelCase). Example: `@Override`, `@SuppressWarnings`.
10. **Generic Methods**: A method that introduces its own type parameters. The naming conventions for type parameters apply. Example: `<T> T max(T a, T b)`.
11. **Camel Case (UpperCamelCase)**: The practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. Used for class and interface names.
12. **Camel Case (lowerCamelCase)**: The first letter is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. Used for method and variable names.
13. **Underscores in Constants**: Used to separate words in constant names for readability.
14. **Abbreviations and Acronyms**: Should not be uppercase when used as part of a name. Example: `XmlHttpRequest`, not `XMLHTTPRequest`.
15. **Boolean Variable Names**: Often start with `is`, `has`, `can`, or similar prefixes to denote a boolean value. Example: `isEmpty`, `hasChildren`.
16. **Method Names (Actions)**: Should reflect what they do, using verb-object pairs where applicable. Example: `sendMessage`, `stopProcess`.
17. **Accessor Methods (getters)**: Start with `get` followed by the variable name in UpperCamelCase. Example: `getColor`, `getSize`.
18. **Mutator Methods (setters)**: Start with `set` followed by the variable name in UpperCamelCase. Example: `setColor`, `setSize`.
19. **Factory Methods**: Named appropriately but often start with `create` or `newInstance`. Example: `newInstance`, `createFile`.
20. **Temporary Variables**: Short names are acceptable, such as `i`, `j`, `k` for indexes in loops.
21. **Avoiding Meaningless Names**: Names like `data`, `info`, `temp` should be avoided unless their use is very obvious.
22. **Use of Underscores**: Apart from constants, underscores are generally not used in identifiers.
23. **Plural Names**: For collections or arrays, names should be pluralized if they represent a collection of objects. Example: `List<String> names`.
24. **Exception Names**: Should be suffixed with `Exception`. Example: `IOException`, `NullPointerException`.
25. **Runnable Implementations**: Often named with a suffix `Runnable` or prefixed with `Runnable`. Example: `CleanupRunnable`, `TaskRunnable`.
26. **Avoiding Conflicts**: Avoid using names that conflict with Java keywords and standard types.
27. **Descriptive Names**: Choose names that describe the purpose or use of the entity being named.
28. **Length of Identifiers**: There's no strict rule, but names should be as short as possible while still being descriptive.
29. **Acronyms in Names**: When using acronyms, maintain the camel case rule, making only the first letter uppercase in mixed-case names.
30. **Constructor Names**: Constructors share the name of the class and follow the same naming convention.
31. **Static Final Variables**: Considered constants and follow the uppercase naming convention.
32. **Avoid Numeric Suffixes**: Instead of `MyClass1`, `MyClass2`, use descriptive names that convey the differences.
33. **Language Consistency**: Stick to the English language for consistency and readability.
34. **Avoid Using Non-ASCII Characters**: While Java supports Unicode characters in names, it's best to avoid them for portability and readability reasons.
35. **Prefixes and Suffixes**: Avoid using type prefixes or suffixes in names (Hungarian notation), e.g., `iCount` (prefix) or `nameStr` (suffix).
36. **Use of Articles**: Generally, avoid using articles (`the`, `an`, `a`) in names.
37. **Disambiguation**: Use more specific names rather than adding numbers or letters to differentiate.
38. **Contextual Naming**: Names should make sense in the context they are used.
39. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't repeat package names in class names.
40. **Logical Grouping**: Related classes and interfaces should have names that reflect their relationship and make them easy to find.
41. **Use Domain Terminology**: Where applicable, use names that reflect domain-specific terms.
42. **Consistent Naming**: Be consistent with naming conventions throughout the project.
43. **Avoiding Reserved Words**: Even if it's technically possible to use certain reserved words by escaping them, avoid this practice.
44. **File Names**: Java file names must match the public class name and have a `.java` extension.
45. **Case Sensitivity**: Java is case-sensitive, which should be considered when naming.
46. **Avoiding Java Keywords**: Names should not be Java keywords or reserved words.
47. **Readable Names**: Names should be easily readable and understandable.
48. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: When creating packages, avoid creating a deeply nested directory structure.
49. **Matching File Structure**: Package names should match the directory structure where the files are located.
50. **Avoiding Ambiguity**: Names should be clear enough to avoid confusion with other entities.
