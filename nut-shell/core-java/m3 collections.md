1. `Collection`: The root interface in the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements.
2. `List`: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). Lists can contain duplicate elements.
3. `ArrayList`: A resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Allows for fast random access of elements.
4. `LinkedList`: A doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. Offers better performance for insert/delete operations.
5. `Set`: A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction.
6. `HashSet`: Implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table. It makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration.
7. `LinkedHashSet`: A hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order.
8. `TreeSet`: A NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap. The elements are ordered using their natural ordering or by a Comparator.
9. `Queue`: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Queues typically, but not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
10. `PriorityQueue`: An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. Elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or by a Comparator.
11. `Deque`: A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. Known as a double-ended queue.
12. `ArrayDeque`: A resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface. It is faster than Stack and LinkedList.
13. `Map`: An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
14. `HashMap`: A hash table based implementation of the Map interface. It allows null values and the null key.
15. `LinkedHashMap`: A hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable iteration order.
16. `TreeMap`: A Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a Comparator.
17. `Iterator`: An interface to iterate over the elements in a collection. It allows to traverse the collection in one direction.
18. `ListIterator`: An iterator for lists that allows the programmer to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's current position in the list.
19. `Comparable`: An interface that imposes a total ordering on the objects of each class that implements it. Used to allow precise control over the sort order.
20. `Comparator`: A comparison function, which imposes a total ordering on some collection of objects. Comparators can be passed to a sort method to allow precise control over the sort order.
21. `Collections`: A utility class that consists of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection.
22. `Arrays`: A utility class that contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching). This class also contains a static factory that allows arrays to be viewed as lists.
23. `ConcurrentModificationException`: This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.
24. `Synchronized Collections`: Collections that are wrapped using the Collections.synchronized* methods to make them thread-safe.
25. `Immutable Collections`: Collections that do not support modification operations (such as add, remove, and clear). They are made immutable using Collections.unmodifiable* methods.
26. `WeakHashMap`: A hashtable-based Map implementation with keys that are held by weak references, allowing a key-value pair to be garbage-collected when the key is no longer referenced outside of the WeakHashMap.
27. `IdentityHashMap`: A hash table with reference-equality semantics for keys. It uses the identity of keys (==) for comparison instead of equals().
28. `EnumSet`: A specialized Set implementation for use with enum types. All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type.
29. `EnumMap`: A specialized Map implementation for use with enum type keys. All of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type.
30. `CopyOnWriteArrayList`: A thread-safe variant of ArrayList in which all mutative operations (add, set, and so on) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.
31. `CopyOnWriteArraySet`: A Set that uses an internal CopyOnWriteArrayList for all of its operations. It is particularly useful in situations where you need to iterate frequently but modify rarely.
32. `BlockingQueue`: A Queue that additionally supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.
33. `BlockingDeque`: A Deque that additionally supports blocking operations that wait for the deque to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the deque when storing an element.
34. `ConcurrentMap`: A Map providing thread safety and atomicity guarantees.
35. `ConcurrentHashMap`: A highly concurrent, high-performance implementation of the ConcurrentMap interface.
36. `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`: A thread-safe queue based on linked nodes. This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
37. `ConcurrentLinkedDeque`: A thread-safe deque based on linked nodes. It allows concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations from both ends.
38. `ConcurrentSkipListSet`: A scalable concurrent NavigableSet implementation based on a ConcurrentSkipListMap.
39. `ConcurrentSkipListMap`: A scalable concurrent ConcurrentNavigableMap implementation.
40. `Collections.sort()`: Sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements or by a provided Comparator.
41. `Collections.binarySearch()`: Searches the specified list for the specified object using the binary search algorithm.
42. `Collections.reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements in the specified list.
43. `Collections.shuffle()`: Randomly permutes the specified list using a default source of randomness.
44. `Collections.swap()`: Swaps the elements at the specified positions in the specified list.
45. `Collections.fill()`: Replaces all of the elements of the specified list with the specified element.
46. `Collections.copy()`: Copies all of the elements from one list into another.
47. `Collections.min()`: Returns the minimum element of the given collection, according to the natural ordering of its elements or by a provided Comparator.
48. `Collections.max()`: Returns the maximum element of the given collection, according to the natural ordering of its elements or by a provided Comparator.
49. `Collections.unmodifiableCollection()`: Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified collection.
50. `Collections.synchronizedCollection()`: Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by the specified collection.
