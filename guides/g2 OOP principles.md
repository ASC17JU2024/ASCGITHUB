# Key OOP Principles:

* **Encapsulation:** Bundles data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class. This protects data integrity by restricting direct access and promoting controlled modifications through methods. 
* **Inheritance:** Enables creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses). This promotes code reuse and simplifies building related objects.
* **Polymorphism:** Allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in distinct ways. This offers flexibility and reduces code duplication.
* **Abstraction:** Hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential functionalities. This simplifies program design and interaction with objects.
