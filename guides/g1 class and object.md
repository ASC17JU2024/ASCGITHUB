# Class and Object


### Class

A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating instances, commonly referred to as objects.

### Object

An object is an instance created from a class blueprint, akin to a tangible product derived from a template.



### Implementation Steps

1. Define a class using the `class` keyword.
2. Instantiate an object using the `new` keyword.

### Example

```java
class Product {
  String name;
  double price;
  
  void display() {
    System.out.println(name + ": $" + price);
  }
}

Product laptop = new Product();
```

### Key Points

- **Class**: Functions as a blueprint.
- **Object**: Represents an instance created from the blueprint.
- **Attributes and Methods**: Classes contain attributes (e.g., name and price) and methods (e.g., display).
- **Object Creation**: Use the `new` keyword to create an object.
- **Multiple Instances**: A class can create multiple objects.
- **Method Definition**: Methods define actions an object can perform.
- **Data Encapsulation**: Objects encapsulate their own data.
- **`this` Keyword**: Refers to the current instance in class methods.
- **Code Organization**: Classes improve code organization and readability.  




* **Constructors:** Special methods invoked during object creation to initialize their state with specific values. Constructors ensure objects are set up properly from the start.
* **`this` Keyword:** Used within a class's methods to refer to the current object instance. This is helpful when a method needs to access or modify the object's own attributes.


**Object Functionality:**

* **Method Operations:** Define actions that objects can perform. These methods encapsulate the object's behavior and manipulate its data.
* **Attribute Storage:** Objects hold their own data (attributes) that represent their characteristics. 

**Benefits of Classes and Objects:**

* **Reusable Code:** Classes promote writing code once and using it for multiple objects. This saves time and reduces redundancy.
* **Organized Code:** Object-oriented design structures code into clear, well-defined classes, making programs easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

In essence, classes and objects provide a powerful approach for building complex systems with well-defined structures, promoting code reusability, and fostering maintainable software.
