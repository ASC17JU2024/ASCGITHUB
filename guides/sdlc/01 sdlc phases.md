Sure, here's a detailed explanation of the SDLC Waterfall model using the Taj Hotels case study as an example:

---

### Case Study: Taj Hotels Affordable Rooms for Freshers

**Objective**: Develop software to manage affordable room bookings for fresh IT professionals joining companies.

---

### 1. Planning Phase

**Objective**: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.

- **Project Manager**:
  - Organizes initial meetings with stakeholders to gather input.
  - Develops a project plan, timeline, and resource allocation.
  - Documents the project goals: creating a system for affordable room bookings for fresh IT professionals.
  
- **Business Analyst**:
  - Collects preliminary information from stakeholders, including hotel managers and potential users (freshers).
  - Helps in defining the scope and feasibility of the project.
  
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Include hotel managers, HR departments of IT companies, and potential guests who provide initial input.

**Outcome**: A comprehensive project plan detailing the timeline, resources, and overall goals.

### 2. Requirement Analysis Phase

**Objective**: Gather and document detailed requirements.

- **Business Analyst**:
  - Conducts interviews and surveys with stakeholders and potential users.
  - Documents functional requirements (e.g., room booking, payment options, customer support) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).
  
- **Product Owner**:
  - Ensures that the documented requirements align with business objectives.
  
- **UX/UI Designer**:
  - Begins preliminary sketches based on user needs and requirements.
  
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Provide detailed feedback and specific requirements to be included in the software.

**Outcome**: A detailed requirements specification document.

### 3. Design Phase

**Objective**: Create detailed system and software design.

- **System Architect**:
  - Designs the overall system architecture, including databases and server setup.
  
- **UX/UI Designer**:
  - Creates detailed wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of the user interface.
  
- **Database Administrator**:
  - Designs the database schema ensuring data integrity and efficient access.
  
- **Security Specialist**:
  - Integrates security measures into the design to protect user data.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Ensures that the design phase adheres to the planned timeline.

**Outcome**: Detailed design documents, including system architecture, UI/UX designs, and database schemas.

---

### 4. Implementation Phase

**Objective**: Develop the software according to design specifications.

- **Developers**:
  - Write and compile the source code for various features such as room availability, booking, and payments.
  
- **Front-End Developers**:
  - Implement the user interface based on the UX/UI designs.
  
- **Back-End Developers**:
  - Develop server-side logic and database interactions.
  
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester**:
  - Conducts initial unit testing to ensure code quality.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Monitors the development process and addresses any roadblocks.

**Outcome**: A functioning software prototype.

---

### 5. Testing Phase

**Objective**: Identify and fix issues to ensure the software is reliable.

- **QA Testers**:
  - Perform comprehensive testing, including functional, performance, and user acceptance testing.
  
- **Developers**:
  - Fix identified bugs and issues.
  
- **Business Analyst**:
  - Validates that the software meets the documented requirements.
  
- **End Users**:
  - Participate in user acceptance testing to provide feedback.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Ensures all tests are completed and issues are resolved before deployment.

**Outcome**: A robust, bug-free software ready for deployment.

---

### 6. Deployment Phase

**Objective**: Launch the software for public use.

- **DevOps Engineer**:
  - Manages the deployment process, including server setup and configuration.
  
- **System Administrator**:
  - Prepares the live environment and ensures stability.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Coordinates the deployment activities and communicates with stakeholders.
  
- **Support Team**:
  - Ready to handle any issues that arise post-deployment.

**Outcome**: The software is live and available for use by fresh IT professionals.

---

### 7. Maintenance Phase

**Objective**: Keep the software running smoothly and up-to-date.

- **Support Team**:
  - Provides ongoing customer support and addresses user issues.
  
- **Developers**:
  - Implement updates, patches, and new features.
  
- **QA Testers**:
  - Test updates to ensure they do not introduce new issues.
  
- **Product Owner**:
  - Prioritizes maintenance tasks and new feature requests.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Oversees maintenance activities and ensures timely resolution of issues.

**Outcome**: Continuous improvement and high user satisfaction.

---

### 8. Evaluation Phase

**Objective**: Review the project to learn and improve future efforts.

- **Business Analyst**:
  - Gathers feedback from users and stakeholders to assess project success.
  
- **Project Manager**:
  - Conducts a post-mortem analysis and documents lessons learned.
  
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Provide feedback on their satisfaction with the project outcome.
  
- **Team Members**:
  - Participate in retrospective meetings to discuss improvements for future projects.

**Outcome**: A comprehensive review that informs future projects and enhances organizational knowledge.
